automating rockets, planes, and fireworks

Using python/C++ (haven't decided) and KOS, create flight control programs.

Python/C++ role will act a master controller/processor, while KOS Telnet will act as slave to the python/C++ controllers commands. 
The KOS Telent will persistently transmit a soup of flight telemetry and information that the python/C++ script will ingest for processing.
